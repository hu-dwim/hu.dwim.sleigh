# hu.dwim.sleigh

## What

An experiment to parse
[Sleigh](https://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/languages/html/sleigh.html) (a
CPU instruction DSL), with the ultimate goal of generating an
assembler for x86_64.

## Status

**It's a pre-alpha experiment.**

## Why

I need an x86_64 assembler for
[Maru](https://github.com/attila-lendvai/maru), and I'm hoping to
later port this to Maru.
